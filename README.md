# 42
Welcome to my coding journey at 42!

## Piscine
#### Passed in September 2023
The 42 piscine is the month-long entry exam for 42.

You can access my Piscine exercises (up to c08) [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/piscine_42). All the exercises done have passed the Moulinette and Norminette.

#### libft
The goal of this project is to code from scratch basic utils functions already available in libraries like stdlib.h, unistd.h and string.h for use in later projects.

__My libft passed with final grade of 125/100. Check out my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/libft).__

#### ft_printf
In this project, I initated myself to variadic functions by coding from scratch a function that aims to replicate the behavior of the printf function from stdio.h for later, more complex projects.

__My ft_printf passed with final grade of 100/100. Check out my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/ft_printf).__

#### get_next_line
The function get_next_line returns the first line of a file passed as a parameter. Thanks to a static variable, the function will return the next line of a file every time it is called.

__My get_next_line passed with final grade of 125/100. Check out my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/get_next_line).__

#### Born2beroot
The goal of this project is to manually partition and setup a VM running on Debian. Several services have been configured like phpmyadmin, wordpress, MariaDB, ufw...

I'm afraid you're gonna have to figure this one out by yourself. __You can check out my monitoring script [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/Born2beroot) though.__

#### FdF
The goal of FdF is to parse a 2D map of integers of variable sizes and render them in a 3D window using the MiniLibX library.

__My FdF passed with final grade of 100/100. Check out my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/FdF).__

#### pipex
Pipex is a program designed to replicate the behaviour of unix pipes "|". Features include interprocess communication, multi-pipes and heredocs in addition to the classic executable commands.

__I haven't completed this project yet, but you can check out what I did so far [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/pipex).__

#### push_swap
Push_swap is a program which goal is to sort a set of random integers by ascending order in the least amount of operations as possible using 2 stacks. Completed by implementing [A. Yigit Ogun](https://github.com/ayogun)'s Turk Algorithm.

__My push_swap passed with final grade of 100/100. Check out my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/push_swap).__

#### Minishell
Minishell aims to replicate basic features of the SH and BASH shells. Not POSIX compliant.

__I haven't completed this project yet.__
